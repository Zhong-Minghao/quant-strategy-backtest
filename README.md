# Quantitative Strategy and Backtest Report

## Strategy Overview
This document presents a quantitative trading strategy implemented during coursework, along with a corresponding backtest report. The strategy is designed to analyze market data and make trading decisions based on predefined rules and indicators.

## Backtest Framework
The backtest was conducted using a modified framework called ryquant, which is derived from Ricequant. This customized framework was specifically developed by my tutor for educational purposes and is not publicly available for installation or distribution. The command is very similar to the rqalpha.api. To understand the meaning of the commands, please refer to
